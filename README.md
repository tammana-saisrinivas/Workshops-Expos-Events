# 🚀 Workshops, Expos & Engineering Events | T. SaiSrinivas

Welcome to my curated collection of workshops, expos, and technical events attended throughout my engineering journey. This repository documents hands-on learning experiences that helped me grow beyond the classroom — from reverse engineering challenges to building and flying my own RC planes.

> 🎓 *"Learning by doing is not just a method — it’s a mindset."*

### 🛠️ 1. Eloqvent Workshop on Reverse Engineering  
**📍 Location:** MLR Institute of Technology  
**📅 Date:** October 2024  
**🏢 Organized by:** EWB (Engineering Without Borders) – IUCEE – MLRIT & IEEE Hyderabad Section  

#### 🔍 What I Learned:
- Principles and applications of **Reverse Engineering**
- **SWOT Analysis** in engineering design
- How to collaborate and communicate with **new teammates**

#### 🧠 Key Highlights:
- Formed a team with complete strangers and coordinated effectively  
- Worked on a **Smart Study Table** with two innovation goals:
  1. **Integrate VR** (MetaQuest 2 + Spatial platform)
  2. **Posture-Correcting Guidance** using ergonomic sensors and reminders

#### 💡 Our Solution:
- Proposed a smart, budget-friendly, and accessible study table  
- Voice-assisted reminders, VR interface, and flexible materials

### 🚁 3. Aerotron 3.0 – 48-Hour Aero Hackathon  
**📍 Location:** MLR Institute of Technology  
**📅 Date:** February 24–26, 2025  
**🏢 Organized by:** Aero Club MLRIT, Wings and Props Pvt. Ltd, Dept. of Aeronautical Engineering  
**🏆 Team Rank:** 3rd Place (Flying Performance) out of 26 teams  
**👨‍✈️ Role:** Team Captain  
**✈️ RC-Aircraft Name:** *The Plane*

#### 🧠 Highlights:
- Participated in an intense 48-hour RC aircraft building challenge  
- Attended theory sessions on:
  - **RC Aircraft Components**
  - **XFLR5 aerodynamic analysis**
  - **Live Drone Show** by Wings and Props Pvt. Ltd

#### ⚙️ What We Did:
- Designed, fabricated, assembled, and flew our own RC aircraft  
- Integrated avionics under time constraints  
- Led a team of peers as captain and coordinated across all build stages

#### 💡 Outcome:
- "TGE Plane" successfully flew during the final round  
- Secured 3rd position in flying out of 26 participating teams
